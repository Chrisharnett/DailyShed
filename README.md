# The Daily Shed

A technical practice app for instrumental learning. The application presents students with short warm-up and technical exercises. The exercises are presented in a repetitive, randomised,  interval based circuit. Current exercises focus on scale based technical skills and long tones for tone development. Future exercises will be added for melodic, creative, and harmonic learning.

The Daily Shed is built with a React frontend, node.js/express backend and flask server to render music notation images using the abjad library.
